# Assignment

Translate the function `between` into Python.

```javascript
function between(x, lower, upper)
{
    return lower <= x && x <= upper
}
```

There are two ways to solve this exercise:

* You translate it word per word.
  You will need to look up the syntax for the [and operator](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=python+and+operator).
* You rely on Python's shorthand syntax.
